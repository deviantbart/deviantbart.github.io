	  <h4>layer 1: consumption as identity</h4>
	  <p>nerds, as american culture knows them, were never a real or valid sociological class until capital said they were. before the eighties, the field of computer science was occupied by both men and women at a pretty ok ratio between the two (of null) gender identities. suddenly the personal computer happened.</p>
	  <p>unlike any other scientific field, interest in computer science was now at the whim of marketers and gender-driven christmas present buying. early personal computer advertisements showed little boys and/or unstylish white twenty year old men suddenly attracting legions of hot babes who wanted to see the men make spreadsheets and play leisure suit larry. this new technology came packed with a new definition of masculinity. these new boys and men with new technology went to college and got programming jobs. they were raised on images of ones masculinity being tied to the consumption of expensive apple and microsoft products.</p>
	  <p> and this framing of men being "the computer-liking gender identity" carried over to the post-atari game console culture. in the 80s the best thing you could be was a man on cocaine in search of entertainment and systems and nintendo's entertainment system was the pinnacle of this state of mind. this was another shift in culture. before nintendo, american gaming meant going to an arcade full of all kinds of people and listening to creedence or funkadelic or something high beyond comprehension on lsd and shake OR playing pong on your family atari. the nintendo was not for the family, it was for you, motherfucker. you can't play mario or zelda two player. this is your power fantasy. you subscribed to a magazine called NINTENDO POWER, you have POWER. CRUSH THE WEAK!! RONALD REAGAN!!!! LETS SMOKE SOME FUCKING CRACK!!! AMERICAN PSYCHO!!!</p>
	  <p>video games evolved with america from 1984 onward. as neoliberal capitalism moved more of its bedbug ridden furniture into our apartment we began to hang out less and do more heroin and pills in our little rooms. we never chose to do these things they just happened to enter our world while we were going to work and trying to keep it together in the midst of all this shit. kurt cobain and the columbine kids (great band name) were on total opposite ends of the political spectrum and still could not handle the ending of history. most people still cannot. </p>
	  <p>with no great otherworldly model to compare you world model to, you feel totally alienated and want to escape. when you find out you can't escape, you must hope that you have access to likeminded people or a gigantic library you can just find meaning in instead. otherwise you are stuck in this realm of the infinite consumer, destined to get so angry at how shitty everything is and feel so lost and confused that you somehow gain a youtube following and start making 100k a year. this is making wallowing in shit your purpose and being put on a pedestal for it. this is somehow feasible in late stage capitalist realism.</p>
	  <p>you can find fake purpose in consumption today and be of any identity without becoming so depressed that you want to kill happy people or yourself. its called being a privileged neoliberal media person with access to mental health facilities. i highly dislike <strong>that shit </strong>and anyone who has bought a nintendo switch instead of using that $300 to donate to the black socialists of america or political prisoners or at the very least bernie sanders. marios not that fucking good. this leads us into the main problem!! that gaming culture, in addition to being a hegemonically "male" thing, is also a very boring and profit-driven thing, and that deep within that very profit-driven quadrant of the gaming culture spectrum also exists this twee bullshit poisoned by the cyclical nature of a sub-sub-culture with no real or valid ideological legs to stand on *heavy breathing* how could anyone be making jokes about $60 environment hurters or think that these things are "games" and not just digital casino objects *vomiting* we must exorcise conservatism and nazism from game culture but also neoliberalism and radical liberalism. this entire spectrum is annoying to deal with, you can afford $60 video games? buy a $30 book and start talking about something not so fucking BORING!</p>

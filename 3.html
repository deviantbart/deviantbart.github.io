      <h4>layer 2: the doritos taunt you don't they</h4>
      <p>before gamergate, there was doritosgate. doritosgate was a charge against corporate relationships with the press. when you see mountain dew gamer fuel in a 7/11 and theres a little game dude on the bottle or you see a little game dude on a bag of doritos you are bearing witness to what capital does to commodifiable studio art that can't save itself. doritos and mountain dew partner with video games all the time. the video game publishers partner with the video game press all the time. technically, by proxy, frito-lay has its hand in art criticism. can you imagine jerry saltz being like, "i would like to mention that combos pretzel snacks greatly improve the viewing of a KAWS." or on the journalistic front, dominos pizza is gaslighting you and shit and telling you they'll never let you mention dominos pizza AGAIN if you tell your readers you found out they're pissing and shitting in the tomato sauce and making employees work unpaid hours.</p>
      <p>in 2011 4chan was all over this. this was an amazing thing to witness. a subculture based entirely on consumption noticing that they were being exploited. it was some matrix shit. nothing was really done about it though, because after this the 4chan video game community noticed that a very entry level feminist critic was using the crowdfunding site kickstarter to seek funds for a youtube video essay series that would deconstruct misogynist tropes in video games. had this been a kickstarter about misogynist tropes in film, or music, or literature, i don't think anyone would have given a shit - for one, those things have been done - but also, those worlds aren't nearly as hegemonically male or neoliberal. you're allowed to be very critical and intellectual about a movie, even from a feminist viewpoint. if you take any poetic license or maybe do some thinking about a video game in a non-functional or metaphorical way - if you as a games writer are not very literally describing the game you are writing about as if it were a fucking washing machine with a few minor mechanical flaws or something - you will be treated as a pariah. as a freak. the anti-intellectual gamer is on pol pot levels of alienation from humanity or meaning</p>
      <p>how potentially out of left-field anita sarkeesian's video essays would have been got a lot of extremely online gamers really riled up. both this and the "gamergate" shit that would happen 2 years or so later would lead us to where we are now, culturally. gamergate was a rehashing of doritosgate, but whereas the enemy of doritosgate was multinational foodstuff and media conglomerates, the enemy of gamergate was women in games media and press and the ethics wherein. whatever that means. at the end of the day, gamergate means nothing. the catalyst of the "movement" is a game called "depression quest". it is a free, unconventional indie game. the quality of it is irrelevant, the contents of the write-up it got on a very prominent gaming website is irrelevant. what is relevant is that the game is so far away from what the hegemony would consider ok or artistically ethical. it is: by a woman, free, not about killing anything, competing against anything, or dating an 11 year old anime character. depression quest was not on the front page of anything, neither was anita sarkeesian's work. there was not a fiery cabal of reptilian scum proliferating their work across the internet like a virus like the "gamergate movement" would have you believe.</p>
      <p> breitbart, the journal of choice for conservative crypto-nazis, covered gamergate as an important political happening. like it was this great controversy. the ex-owner of 4chan, moot, banned all discussion of gamergate from the site because he saw how stupid it was. gamergate's new home became 8chan. you may know 8chan as the site the guy who shot up a mosque in new zealand went to. gamergate and the alt-right were synthesized right next to each other. the decline of any sincere community on 4chan coincided with the creation of these things. they used to do cool shit, seriously. occupy wall street, whatever. some theorize the white nationalist site "stormfront" saw the potentiality of 4chan's userbase. thousands of identityless, but pre-dominantly, alienated white men very open to finding something to believe in. one could guess they saw anonymity as a blank canvas to paint white. (wow) the theorized invasions happened around the same time as gamergate. people definitely became more racist on the site around then. the wound only gets more infected supposedly, but a lot of 4chan's userbase now is just old people who found it through liking donald trump. i think people on 4chan are getting burnout, thats why they're #yanggang now. they are still depressed and lost, but they might become left accelerationists. this doesnt matter that much but never forget that this started with gaming culture. angry unemployed people with no degrees really like video games. and junk food... and are susceptible to fascist propaganda... doritos cheetos or fritos... dorito mussolini</p>

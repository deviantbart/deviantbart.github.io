      <h4>surface: entering the vampire's castle</h4>
      <p> i could never imagine taking the time to learn how to code and not wanting to just absolutely fuck shit up with your new skill. it hurts to know that the language of video games is and has always been neoliberalism. it could be something else, no doubt. right now it plays itself safe. there is little room for detournement, or transgression, or critique. being at play is a moment of total liberation. a game is a moment to escape - not from reality, but from the ambient oppression we all face on varying levels. if capitalism is the sun that is burning us all to death, art and ludic spaces are shady areas. they are clouds that can move in front of the sun and tell the sun to fuck off for a little bit. yes, the sun dissipates the cloud sometimes and we will burn again. we see so many games constructed by the sun. why is the sun making games? i do not want to play the sun's games. the fucking sun..</p>
      <p>as a poor kid i never wanted to take video games this seriously. at some point i wanted to become a professional dj or be in an emo band. and make a lot of money with my trauma and adhd. then i got a tumblr and heard about aids-3d, i thought post-internet art was so cool, and then all the politics happened and now i just want video games to either stop existing or be a catalyst for some kind of insane democratized art movement that will allow radical political thought that is actually good and not stupid to be realized... or something. i would love to see a beautiful emotional realism in video games the same way upper middle class gamers want a beautiful imaginary fantasy to escape to. im glad i dont understand them</p>
      <p>my central theseses for all this shit is:</p>
      <p>- self identified gamers/nerds, as in, the hegemonic social class that most people who play video games fall into, are slaves to capitalist realist depression and are sad, lost souls as all nerds are. if they happen to believe in fascism, this is a reaction to the anti-intellectualism present in games culture, which is caused by the lack of intellectualism present in games culture.</p>
      <p>- the more we think of video games as something that can transcend neoliberal thought the more they will be able to transcend that shit. the more we write about things like the materiality of video games, the sociological implications of video games, the labor concerns in games, class and video games, the cultural relevance of video games. the more we tie that back to philosophy and political theory like we do with film and everything else!! the less twee we act, the meaner we get, the more ambiently politically involved we get as people adjacent to video games. this is all so important. you may not like that its important, i know i dont like that its important, but it is important. there is so much work to be done to legitimize a better kind of games. lets not legitimize the overall games we have now. they are shit, do not condone or endorse most games.</p>
      <p>- steal expensive shit, steal as much expensive shit as you can. only buy cheap things from people who would answer your email</p>
